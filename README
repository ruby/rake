= CompTree -- Parallel Computation Tree

=== Synopsis
  
  require 'comp_tree'
  
  CompTree::Driver.new { |driver|

    # Define a function named 'area' taking these three arguments.
    driver.define_area(:width, :height, :offset) { |width, height, offset|
      width*height - offset
    }
    
    # Define a function 'width' which takes a 'border' argument.
    driver.define_width(:border) { |border|
      2 + border
    }
    
    # Ditto for 'height'.
    driver.define_height(:border) { |border|
      3 + border
    }
    
    # Define a constant function 'border'.
    driver.define_border {
      5
    }
    
    # Ditto for 'offset'.
    driver.define_offset {
      7
    }
    
    # Compute the area using four parallel threads.
    area = driver.compute(:area, :threads => 4)

    # We've done this computation.
    if area == (2 + 5)*(3 + 5) - 7
      puts "It worked!"
    else
      puts "Send bug report to ..."
    end
  }

==== Alternative Forms for Function Definitions

This form evals a lambda, saving you the repeat parameter list:

  driver.define_area :width, :height, :offset, %{
    width*height - offset
  }
  
  driver.define_width :border, %{
    2 + border
  }
  
Notice the '<code>%</code>' before the brace.  The lambda is created
just once, during the time of definition.

Finally there is the raw form which uses no +eval+ or
+method_missing+ tricks:

  driver.define(:area, :width, :height, :offset) { |width, height, offset|
    width*height - offset
  }
        
  driver.define(:width, :border) { |border|
    2 + border
  }

=== Important Notes

The user should have a basic understanding of <em>functional
programming</em> (see for example
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) and the meaning
of <em>side effects</em>.

CompTree requires a functional style.  Every function you define must
explicitly depend on the data it uses.

  #
  # BAD example: depending on state -- offset not listed as a parameter
  #
  driver.define_area(:width, :height) { |width, height|
    width*height - offset
  }

Unless <em>offset</em> is really a constant, the result of
<tt>driver.compute(:area, :num_threads => n)</tt> is not well-defined
for _n_ > 1.

Just as depending on some external changeable state is bad, it is
likewise bad to affect an external state (to produce a <em>side
effect</em>).

  #
  # BAD example: affecting state
  #
  driver.define_area(:width, :height, :offset) { |width, height, offset|
    ACCUMULATOR.add "more data"
    width*height - offset
  }

Given a tree where nodes are modifying _ACCUMULATOR_, the end state of
_ACCUMULATOR_ is not well-defined.  Moreover if _ACCUMULATOR_ is not
thread-safe, the result will be even worse.
