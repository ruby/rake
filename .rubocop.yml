These PNC Bank Acquirer Terms (“Member Bank Terms”) are additional terms applicable to the Stripe Payments Services for Visa and Mastercard products for which PNC Bank, N.A. (“Member Bank”) is a Payment Method Acquirer (“VM Payment Processing Services”). In these Member Bank Terms, Visa and Mastercard may be referred to individually as a “Network” and collectively as the “Networks”, and the rules issued by a Network are the “Network Rules.” Additionally, for purposes of these Member Bank Terms, if you are registered with a Network pursuant to applicable Network Rules, you are considered “Network Registered.” Any terms used but not defined in these Member Bank Terms will have the meaning provided in the Stripe Services Agreement (“Agreement”).
These Member Bank Terms constitute a legal agreement among you, Stripe, and Member Bank, a national bank, with offices at 300 Fifth Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15222. The legal agreement is formed by Member Bank’s and Stripe’s offer of these Member Bank Terms to you, your acceptance of these Member Bank Terms, and Member Bank’s and Stripe’s subsequent provision of VM Payment Processing Services to you.
These Member Bank Terms are offered to you, and the legal agreement established by these Member Bank Terms becomes effective as provided below.
For all users of the VM Payment Processing Services, except Network Registered users: These Member Bank Terms become effective only when you process more than $1 million in Transactions on a Network within any twelve-month period. Importantly, the $1 million threshold for effectiveness of these Member Bank Terms is set by each Network, and either Network may change its threshold for effectiveness of these Member Bank Terms at any time with no notice to you. Until you process more than $1 million in Transactions on a Network (or such other processing thresholds as may be established by either Network), these Member Bank Terms are not effective, and you do not have a direct legal agreement with Member Bank with respect to the VM Payment Processing Services. For Network Registered users of the VM Payment Processing Services: These Member Bank Terms become effective when you process your first Transaction on a Network. You understand and agree that Stripe or Member Bank may enforce any provisions of the Agreement that relate to Stripe or Member Bank’s provision of or your use of the VM Payment Processing Services, and you acknowledge that you are directly responsible to Member Bank under the Agreement for any liability to Member Bank caused by your breach of the Agreement. Stripe or Member Bank may also terminate these Member Bank Terms at any time, which may limit or terminate your ability to use the VM Payment Processing Services. Further, either Network may, at any time for any reason, terminate these Member Bank Terms with respect to Payment Processing Services for its products.
You must accept all of the terms and conditions of these Member Bank Terms to use the VM Payment Processing Services. If you do not accept them, you may not receive VM Payment Processing Services.
Network Compliance and Disclosure Important Member Bank Disclosures: Member Bank discloses that (i) it is the only entity approved to extend acceptance of Visa and Mastercard products directly to you under these Member Bank Terms; (ii) it must be a principal party to these Member Bank Terms; (iii) it is responsible for educating you on the Network Rules with which you must comply, but this information may be provided to you by Stripe; and (iv) subject to Section 4 of these Member Bank Terms, with respect to Transactions processed through the VM Payment Processing Services, it is responsible for and must provide the Settlement Funds (as defined below) that it receives to Stripe (or Stripe’s designated financial services provider) for Stripe’s distribution to you; and (v) with respect to Transactions processed through the VM Payment Processing Services, Stripe is responsible for all funds that may be held in reserve that are derived from your Settlement Funds.Your Responsibilities: In addition to any other responsibilities set forth in these Member Bank Terms, you agree that, at all times throughout the term of these Member Bank Terms, you will (i) comply with the PCI Standards in using and maintaining Payment Account Details; (ii) maintain fraud and Dispute rates acceptable under the Network Rules; (iii) review and understand the terms of these Member Bank Terms; (iv) comply with the Network Rules and Laws; and (v) comply with the Agreement.
Stripe is registered as a Payment Facilitator and an Independent Sales Organization (ISO) by Member Bank. You may contact Member Bank by writing to PNC Bank, N.A., 1600 Market Street, 8th Floor, Philadelphia, PA 19103.
Purpose of these Member Bank Terms When you process more than $1 million within any twelve-month period in Visa or Mastercard Transactions through a particular Payment Method Acquirer, or, if you are Network Registered, when you process your first Visa or Mastercard Transaction through a particular Payment Method Acquirer, applicable Network Rules require you to enter into a direct contractual relationship with the Payment Method Acquirer. These Member Bank Terms constitute your direct contractual relationship with Member Bank, which is a member of the Networks, and a Payment Method Acquirer for Visa and Mastercard Transactions. In accordance with the requirements of the Network Rules, these Member Bank Terms are offered and effective, and your direct contractual relationship with Member Bank is established, as provided in the introductory paragraphs above.As a Payment Method Acquirer, Member Bank authorizes you to accept payment from your Customers by Visa and Mastercard credit or debit card (“VM Payment Cards”). However, by using the VM Payment Processing Services and accepting VM Payment Cards, you are not establishing a depository or other account with Member Bank. As between Stripe and Member Bank, Stripe is responsible for underwriting and evaluating your eligibility to receive the VM Payment Processing Services, authorizing charges, settling funds to your User Bank Account(s) as provided in Section 4, and providing the VM Payment Processing Services pursuant to the terms of the Agreement.
Stripe, and not Member Bank, will provide customer service to you to resolve any issues you may have related to your use of the VM Payment Processing Services; however, you may contact Member Bank (using the contact information provided above) in the event you are unable to resolve any matters directly with Stripe. You are solely responsible for providing support to your Customers for all issues related to your products and services.
Compliance with Visa and Mastercard Rules When you use the VM Payment Processing Services to accept charges from VM Payment Cards, you must comply with the Network Rules, including the acceptance guidelines, monitoring programs, and activity reporting (including excessive credits, Disputes, or deposits) set forth therein. Under the Network Rules, certain activity may subject you to Disputes, fees, fines, settlement delays, withholdings, audits of your processing activity, or termination of these Member Bank Terms and/or the Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, you specifically agree to:i. Only submit Transactions authorized by the cardholder;
ii. Only accept payment for the sale of products or services, and receipt of bona fide donations, conducted by you pursuant to your business as indicated in your Stripe Account and not for any products, services, or donations (i) prohibited by Laws or Network Rules, or (ii) that qualify as Restricted Businesses, unless you have received prior written approval from Stripe;
iii. Submit a Transaction for the full amount owed by the Customer for the Transaction except where you and the Customer agree on a partial shipment (such as receiving a portion of an order), or where the Transaction qualifies for delayed delivery or special order deposits (such as paying for a deposit on a custom-built product);
iv. Not establish minimum or maximum amounts (except as permitted by the Network Rules), or condition charges for use of VM Payment Cards, and not discourage the use of one VM Payment Card brand over another;
v. Not impose surcharges or taxes (except where permitted by Law and the Network Rules) and, where so done, you will only collect such amounts as part of the submitted charge;
vi. Not submit a Transaction that represents collection of a dishonored check;
vii. Only use the Network logos or marks in a manner permitted by the Network Rules;
viii. Prohibit use of Payment Cards for disbursement of cash (except as permitted by the Network Rules);
ix. Comply with the security obligations identified in the Agreement, including compliance with the PCI Standards and only use cardholder data as permitted, and certify such compliance upon request, and not permit or promote fraudulent use of VM Payment Cards or cardholder data;
x. Make clear to Customers that they are transacting with you prior to, during, and after the Transaction, including providing clear statement descriptors;
xi. Use all reasonable methods to resolve disputes with Customers, including those resulting in a Dispute, and not attempt to recharge a Customer for a Transaction that was previously Disputed and subsequently returned to you unless the recharge is expressly authorized by the Customer; and
xii. Provide clear refund and exchange language that is consistent with Laws and the Network Rules.
Authorization for Settlement and Disbursement of Funds When Member Bank receives funds from the Networks for settlement of your Card Payments (“Settlement Funds”), Member Bank will provide the Settlement Funds to Stripe or Stripe Payments Company, which will accept the Settlement Funds on your behalf. You agree to designate Stripe and Stripe Payments Company as your agent for purposes of receiving Settlement Funds, and you authorize Stripe to instruct Member Bank on your behalf on how and when to make transfers of Settlement Funds to Stripe, including the initiation of holds, receipts, and disbursements of Settlement Funds. Settlement Funds will be held by Stripe in pooled merchant funds accounts pending disbursement to you (or any applicable third-party recipient you have instructed Stripe to make a disbursement to on your behalf) in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, including these Member Bank Terms.You agree you are not entitled to access the Settlement Funds prior to the Settlement Funds being credited by Stripe to your User Bank Account (or the bank account of a third-party recipient to which you have instructed Stripe to make a disbursement on your behalf). You further agree that you have no right to direct Member Bank to distribute Settlement Funds, that you may not assign any interest in any Settlement Funds held by Member Bank, and that you are not entitled to any interest or other compensation associated with the Settlement Funds held by Member Bank. Any authorizations set forth in these Member Bank Terms will remain in full force and effect until your Stripe Account is closed or terminated.
You agree that Member Bank’s transfer of Settlement Funds to your designated agents, Stripe or Stripe Payments Company, satisfies Member Bank’s settlement obligation to you, and that, after Member Bank transfers Settlement Funds to Stripe or Stripe Payments Company, any dispute or claim you may have regarding the receipt or amount of Settlement Funds will be between you and Stripe or Stripe Payments Company. Further, if a cardholder disputes a Transaction, if a Transaction is Disputed for any reason, or if Member Bank reasonably believes a Transaction is unauthorized or otherwise unacceptable, the amount of such Transaction may be Disputed and debited from Settlement Funds held by Member Bank.
Sharing of Data a. You authorize Stripe and Member Bank to provide Protected Data to each other to (i) provide the VM Payment Processing Services, (ii) comply with legal and regulatory obligations, and (iii) perform underwriting and risk review, including verification that you are legally permitted to transact and receive funds. This includes sharing information you provided to Stripe before these Member Bank Terms became effective and information about Member Bank and Stripe’s experience with you, such as termination of these Member Bank Terms by Member Bank and the reasons for such termination. Where required to comply with our obligations under Laws, the Network Rules, or any of Member Bank’s regulatory obligations, Member Bank may provide any data to law enforcement, the Networks, or other government regulators.b. To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires each financial institution to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who establishes a customer relationship with the financial institution. To comply with this requirement, you authorize and direct Stripe to provide to Member Bank any information required to verify your identity, including your name, address, and taxpayer identification number. If you are a legal entity, including a limited liability company or corporation, you authorize and direct Stripe to provide Member Bank with information on the identity of (1) all beneficial owners of 25% or more of the company; and (2) at least one individual with significant control over the company.
Term and Termination These Member Bank Termsbecome effective as provided in the introductory paragraphs and shall continue in effect so long as you use the VM Payment Processing Services.These Member Bank Terms will terminate automatically upon termination of the Agreement, except for those terms which are intended to survive termination. In addition, the VM Payment Processing Services and/or these Member Bank Terms may be terminated by Member Bank, Stripe, or either Network as provided in the introductory paragraphs.
Representations and Warranties In addition to the representations and warranties made in the Agreement, which are incorporated by reference to this Addendum in their entirety, you represent and warrant to Member Bank and Stripe as of each day on which you receive VM Payment Processing Services that:
a. You are legally able to enter into these Member Bank Terms;
b. You will not use the VM Payment Processing Services, directly or indirectly, for any fraudulent or illegal undertaking; and
c. You will only use the VM Payment Processing Services in a manner consistent with the Agreement, including these Member Bank Terms, the Documentation, and Network Rules.
Indemnification Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in the Agreement, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Member Bank, and its respective employees, directors, agents, subcontractors and affiliates (collectively the “Member Bank Entities”) from and against any claim, suit, demand, loss, liability, damage (including indirect or consequential damage), action, or proceeding arising out of or relating to (a) your breach of any provision of the Agreement or these Member Bank Terms; (b) your use of the VM Payment Processing Services; (c) your obligations to pay fees or fines to Stripe, your Customers, Payment Method Providers, or third parties; (d) your negligence or willful misconduct or the negligence or willful misconduct of your employees, contractors, or agents; and (e) all third-party indemnity obligations Member Bank incurs as a direct or indirect result of your acts or omissions (including indemnification of any Network, card issuer, or intermediary bank).
Disclaimer of Warranties THE SERVICES DESCRIBED IN THESE MEMBER BANK TERMS ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, QUALITY, SUITABILTY, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. ALL DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES PROVIDED IN THE AGREEMENT WILL APPLY EQUALLY TO THE MEMBER BANK ENTITIES AS THEY DO TO STRIPE. THE MEMBER BANK ENTITIES (A) ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR OR STRIPE’S FAILURE TO PERFORM OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE AGREEMENT AND (B) DO NOT WARRANT, ENDORSE, GUARANTEE, OR ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY PRODUCT OR SERVICE ADVERTISED OR OFFERED BY YOU, STRIPE, OR ANY THIRD PARTY.
Limitations on Liability In no event will the Member Bank Entities be liable for any lost profits, lost revenue, lost business opportunity, loss of data, or any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages arising out of, in connection with, or relating to the Agreement, these Member Bank Terms, or the VM Payment Processing Services described in either, including without limitation the use of, inability to use, or unavailability of services provided by Stripe. Under no circumstances will any of the Member Bank Entities be responsible for any damage, loss, or injury resulting from hacking, tampering, or other unauthorized access, or use of the VM Payment Processing Services, your Stripe Account, or Protected Data, or your failure to use or implement security, controls, or processes that are appropriate for your business.
The Member Bank Entities assume no liability or responsibility for any (a) personal injury or property damage, of any nature whatsoever, resulting from your access to or use of the VM Payment Processing Services; (b) any misuse of VM Payment Processing Services or Protected Data; (c) any interruption or cessation of transmission to or from the VM Payment Processing Services; (d) any software bugs, viruses, or other harmful code that may be transmitted to, through, or in connection with the VM Payment Processing Services; (e) any errors, inaccuracies, or omissions in the VM Payment Processing Services or data, or any loss or damage resulting therefrom, regardless of the manner of transmission; or (f) defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of any third party.
The Member Bank Entities’ cumulative liability to you is limited to direct damages and in all events will not exceed in the aggregate the amount of fees or compensation actually received by Member Bank from Stripe for the Transactions processed for you through the VM Payment Processing Services during the three (3) month period immediately preceding the event that gives rise to the claim for liability. The limitation of liability in the preceding sentence will not apply to claims by you against Member Bank for direct damages for failure to transfer Settlement Funds to Stripe in accordance with Section 4 of these Member Bank Terms, in which case Member Bank liability for such direct claim by you is limited to the amount of any Settlement Funds that Member Bank failed to transfer to Stripe in accordance with Section 4 of these Member Bank Terms.
Without limiting anything to the contrary above, you agree to provide Member Bank, via a communication with Stripe, with written notice of any alleged breach by Member Bank of these Member Bank Terms, which notice will specifically detail such alleged breach, within sixty (60) days of the date on which you discovered or reasonably should have discovered the alleged breach. Failure to provide notice shall be deemed an acceptance by you and a waiver of any and all rights to dispute such breach.
The foregoing will apply to the fullest extent permitted by law in the applicable jurisdiction and will apply regardless of the legal theory on which the claim is based, including without limitation contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or any other basis. The limitations apply even if Stripe or Member Bank have been advised of the possibility of such damage.
United States Only Services; No Illegal Activities You may not use the VM Payment Processing Services or services of any kind offered by Member Bank from, or on behalf of persons or entities (a) in a country embargoed by the United States or (b) blocked or denied by the United States government. You further acknowledge and agree that you will not use your Stripe Account and/or the VM Payment Processing Services for illegal Transactions, for example, those prohibited by the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act, 31 U.S.C. Section 5361 et seq., as may be amended from time to time, or those involving any Person listed on the U.S. Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (available at www.treas.gov/ofac) or the U.S. Department of State Terrorist Exclusion List (available at www.state.gov) or the processing and acceptance of Transactions in certain jurisdictions pursuant to 31 CFR Part 500 et seq. and other laws enforced by OFAC. Unless otherwise explicitly stated, the VM Payment Processing Services are solely for use by you in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Member Bank Terms, Member Bank may decline to process any Transaction submitted by you in its sole discretion.
Dispute Resolution All disputes under these Member Bank Terms are subject to the applicable provisions of the Agreement. In particular, the dispute resolution, class action waiver, and arbitration provisions of the Agreement apply to disputes under these Member Bank Terms by, with, or against Member Bank in the same manner they apply to disputes by, with, or against Stripe, except that (a) in the event of arbitration, only a federal court (and not an arbitrator) may determine whether a particular claim is arbitrable, and (b) service to Member Bank must be made to its registered agent or to PNC Bank, N.A., 1600 Market Street, 8th Floor, Philadelphia, PA 19103.
Waiver The failure of Member Bank to assert any of its rights under these Member Bank Terms or the Agreement shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver by Member Bank of its rights to enforce each and every provision of these Member Bank Terms or the Agreement in accordance with their terms. These Member Bank Terms may be amended by Member Bank or Stripe from time to time in the same manner as the Agreement may be amended by Stripe.
Miscellaneous These Member Bank Terms are entered into, governed by, and construed pursuant to the laws of the State of New York without regard to conflicts of law provisions. These Member Bank Terms may not be assigned by you without the prior written consent of Member Bank and Stripe. These Member Bank Terms shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors, transferees, and assignees. If any provision of these Member Bank Terms are determined to be illegal or invalid, such illegality or invalidity of that provision will not affect any of the remaining provisions and these Member Bank Terms will be construed as if such provision is not contained in these Member Bank Terms.

Set your workflow to run on pull_request events that target the main branch
on: pull_request: branches: - main
Set your workflow to run every day of the week from Monday to Friday at 2:00 UTC
on: schedule: - cron: "0 2 * * 1-5"
For more information, see "Events that trigger workflows."
Manually running a workflow
To manually run a-multi-line-multi-command-line_build_script_runner-powwershell-WIZARD_setup-installation-set-up-WIZARD'@WORKSFLOW.md :
workflow, you can configure your workflow to use the workflow_dispatch event. This enables a "Run workflow" button on the Actions tab.
on: workflow_dispatch:
For more information, see "Manually running a workflow."
Running your jobs on different operating systems
GitHub Actions provides hosted runners for Linux, Windows, and macOS.
To set the operating system for your job, specify the operating system using runs-on:
jobs: my_job: name: deploy to staging runs-on: ubuntu-18.04
The available virtual machine types are:
ubuntu-latest, ubuntu-18.04, or ubuntu-16.04
windows-latest or windows-2019
macos-latest or macos-10.15
For more information, see "Virtual environments for GitHub Actions."
Using an action
Actions are reusable units of code that can be built and distributed by anyone on GitHub. You can find a variety of actions in GitHub Marketplace, and also in the official Actions repository.
To use an action, you must specify the repository that contains the action. We also recommend that you specify a Git tag to ensure you are using a released version of the action.
- name: Setup Node uses: actions/setup-node@v1 with: node-version: '10.x
For more information, see "Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions
Running a command
You can run commands on the job's virtual machine.
- name: Install Dependencies run: npm install
For more information, see "Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions."
Running a job across a matrix of operating systems and runtime versions
You can automatically run a job across a set of different values, such as different versions of code libraries or operating systems.
For example, this job uses a matrix strategy to run cross 3 versions of Node and 3 operating systems:
jobs: test: name: Test on node ${{ matrix.node_version }} and ${{ matrix.os }} runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }} strategy: matrix: node_version: ['8', '10', '12'] os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macOS-latest] steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v1 - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node_version }} uses: actions/setup-node@v1 with: node-version: ${{ matrix.node_version }} - name: npm install, build and test run: | npm install npm run build --if-present npm test
For more information, see "Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions."
Running steps or jobs conditionally
GitHub Actions supports conditions on steps and jobs using data present in your workflow context
For example, to run a step only as part of a push and not in a pull_request, you can specify a condition in the if: property based on the event name:
steps: - run: 
NPC :AUTOMATE :publish.yml :
 if :true.:continue-on-false :
 github.event_name == 'Pushs/Response.md '

+Installing the Sun Java JDK
+
+When you install the Sun Java SDK, you must install it to a path that does not have any spaces.
+
+To install the Sun Java SDK:
+
+Double-click the JDK installer file that you downloaded (jdk-6u43-windows-x64.exe).
+
+The welcome page of the JDK installation wizard is displayed.
+
+
+￼
+
+On the welcome page, click Next.
+
+On the Custom Setup page, because the default installation location (under Program Files) has a space, you must change it here. To change the JDK installation location:
+
+￼
+
+Click the Change button.
+
+In the Folder name field, remove the Program Files directory. This changes the location to: C:\Java\jdk1.6.0_43\
+
+￼
+
+Click OK.
+
+On the Custom Setup page, verify that the installation location has been updated, then click Next.
+
+￼
+
+The Destination Folder page sets the location of the public JRE. Because this JRE is not used by Endeca Information Discovery, you can leave the default directory. Click Next.
+
+￼
+
+The installation process begins.
+
+When the installation is completed, click Finish.

+Installing the Sun Java JDK
+
+When you install the Sun Java SDK, you must install it to a path that does not have any spaces.
+
+To install the Sun Java SDK:
+
+Double-click the JDK installer file that you downloaded (jdk-6u43-windows-x64.exe).
+
+The welcome page of the JDK installation wizard is displayed.
+
+
+￼
+
+On the welcome page, click Next.
+
+On the Custom Setup page, because the default installation location (under Program Files) has a space, you must change it here. To change the JDK installation location:
+
+￼
+
+Click the Change button.
+
+In the Folder name field, remove the Program Files directory. This changes the location to: C:\Java\jdk1.6.0_43\
+
+￼
+
+Click OK.
+
+On the Custom Setup page, verify that the installation location has been updated, then click Next.
+
+￼
+
+The Destination Folder page sets the location of the public JRE. Because this JRE is not used by Endeca Information Discovery, you can leave the default directory. Click Next.
+
+￼
+
+The installation process begins.
+
+When the installation is completed, click Finish.

Installing the Sun Java JDK

When you install the Sun Java SDK, you must install it to a path that does not have any spaces.

To install the Sun Java SDK:

Double-click the JDK installer file that you downloaded (jdk-6u43-windows-x64.exe).

The welcome page of the JDK installation wizard is displayed.


￼

On the welcome page, click Next.

On the Custom Setup page, because the default installation location (under Program Files) has a space, you must change it here. To change the JDK installation location:

￼

Click the Change button.

In the Folder name field, remove the Program Files directory. This changes the location to: C:\Java\jdk1.6.0_43\

￼

Click OK.

On the Custom Setup page, verify that the installation location has been updated, then click Next.

￼

The Destination Folder page sets the location of the public JRE. Because this JRE is not used by Endeca Information Discovery, you can leave the default directory. Click Next.

￼

The installation process begins.

When the installation is completed, click Finish.

These PNC Bank Acquirer Terms (“Member Bank Terms”) are additional terms applicable to the Stripe Payments Services for Visa and Mastercard products for which PNC Bank, N.A. (“Member Bank”) is a Payment Method Acquirer (“VM Payment Processing Services”). In these Member Bank Terms, Visa and Mastercard may be referred to individually as a “Network” and collectively as the “Networks”, and the rules issued by a Network are the “Network Rules.” Additionally, for purposes of these Member Bank Terms, if you are registered with a Network pursuant to applicable Network Rules, you are considered “Network Registered.” Any terms used but not defined in these Member Bank Terms will have the meaning provided in the Stripe Services Agreement (“Agreement”).
These Member Bank Terms constitute a legal agreement among you, Stripe, and Member Bank, a national bank, with offices at 300 Fifth Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15222. The legal agreement is formed by Member Bank’s and Stripe’s offer of these Member Bank Terms to you, your acceptance of these Member Bank Terms, and Member Bank’s and Stripe’s subsequent provision of VM Payment Processing Services to you.
These Member Bank Terms are offered to you, and the legal agreement established by these Member Bank Terms becomes effective as provided below.
For all users of the VM Payment Processing Services, except Network Registered users: These Member Bank Terms become effective only when you process more than $1 million in Transactions on a Network within any twelve-month period. Importantly, the $1 million threshold for effectiveness of these Member Bank Terms is set by each Network, and either Network may change its threshold for effectiveness of these Member Bank Terms at any time with no notice to you. Until you process more than $1 million in Transactions on a Network (or such other processing thresholds as may be established by either Network), these Member Bank Terms are not effective, and you do not have a direct legal agreement with Member Bank with respect to the VM Payment Processing Services. For Network Registered users of the VM Payment Processing Services: These Member Bank Terms become effective when you process your first Transaction on a Network. You understand and agree that Stripe or Member Bank may enforce any provisions of the Agreement that relate to Stripe or Member Bank’s provision of or your use of the VM Payment Processing Services, and you acknowledge that you are directly responsible to Member Bank under the Agreement for any liability to Member Bank caused by your breach of the Agreement. Stripe or Member Bank may also terminate these Member Bank Terms at any time, which may limit or terminate your ability to use the VM Payment Processing Services. Further, either Network may, at any time for any reason, terminate these Member Bank Terms with respect to Payment Processing Services for its products.
You must accept all of the terms and conditions of these Member Bank Terms to use the VM Payment Processing Services. If you do not accept them, you may not receive VM Payment Processing Services.
Network Compliance and Disclosure Important Member Bank Disclosures: Member Bank discloses that (i) it is the only entity approved to extend acceptance of Visa and Mastercard products directly to you under these Member Bank Terms; (ii) it must be a principal party to these Member Bank Terms; (iii) it is responsible for educating you on the Network Rules with which you must comply, but this information may be provided to you by Stripe; and (iv) subject to Section 4 of these Member Bank Terms, with respect to Transactions processed through the VM Payment Processing Services, it is responsible for and must provide the Settlement Funds (as defined below) that it receives to Stripe (or Stripe’s designated financial services provider) for Stripe’s distribution to you; and (v) with respect to Transactions processed through the VM Payment Processing Services, Stripe is responsible for all funds that may be held in reserve that are derived from your Settlement Funds.Your Responsibilities: In addition to any other responsibilities set forth in these Member Bank Terms, you agree that, at all times throughout the term of these Member Bank Terms, you will (i) comply with the PCI Standards in using and maintaining Payment Account Details; (ii) maintain fraud and Dispute rates acceptable under the Network Rules; (iii) review and understand the terms of these Member Bank Terms; (iv) comply with the Network Rules and Laws; and (v) comply with the Agreement.
Stripe is registered as a Payment Facilitator and an Independent Sales Organization (ISO) by Member Bank. You may contact Member Bank by writing to PNC Bank, N.A., 1600 Market Street, 8th Floor, Philadelphia, PA 19103.
Purpose of these Member Bank Terms When you process more than $1 million within any twelve-month period in Visa or Mastercard Transactions through a particular Payment Method Acquirer, or, if you are Network Registered, when you process your first Visa or Mastercard Transaction through a particular Payment Method Acquirer, applicable Network Rules require you to enter into a direct contractual relationship with the Payment Method Acquirer. These Member Bank Terms constitute your direct contractual relationship with Member Bank, which is a member of the Networks, and a Payment Method Acquirer for Visa and Mastercard Transactions. In accordance with the requirements of the Network Rules, these Member Bank Terms are offered and effective, and your direct contractual relationship with Member Bank is established, as provided in the introductory paragraphs above.As a Payment Method Acquirer, Member Bank authorizes you to accept payment from your Customers by Visa and Mastercard credit or debit card (“VM Payment Cards”). However, by using the VM Payment Processing Services and accepting VM Payment Cards, you are not establishing a depository or other account with Member Bank. As between Stripe and Member Bank, Stripe is responsible for underwriting and evaluating your eligibility to receive the VM Payment Processing Services, authorizing charges, settling funds to your User Bank Account(s) as provided in Section 4, and providing the VM Payment Processing Services pursuant to the terms of the Agreement.
Stripe, and not Member Bank, will provide customer service to you to resolve any issues you may have related to your use of the VM Payment Processing Services; however, you may contact Member Bank (using the contact information provided above) in the event you are unable to resolve any matters directly with Stripe. You are solely responsible for providing support to your Customers for all issues related to your products and services.
Compliance with Visa and Mastercard Rules When you use the VM Payment Processing Services to accept charges from VM Payment Cards, you must comply with the Network Rules, including the acceptance guidelines, monitoring programs, and activity reporting (including excessive credits, Disputes, or deposits) set forth therein. Under the Network Rules, certain activity may subject you to Disputes, fees, fines, settlement delays, withholdings, audits of your processing activity, or termination of these Member Bank Terms and/or the Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, you specifically agree to:i. Only submit Transactions authorized by the cardholder;
ii. Only accept payment for the sale of products or services, and receipt of bona fide donations, conducted by you pursuant to your business as indicated in your Stripe Account and not for any products, services, or donations (i) prohibited by Laws or Network Rules, or (ii) that qualify as Restricted Businesses, unless you have received prior written approval from Stripe;
iii. Submit a Transaction for the full amount owed by the Customer for the Transaction except where you and the Customer agree on a partial shipment (such as receiving a portion of an order), or where the Transaction qualifies for delayed delivery or special order deposits (such as paying for a deposit on a custom-built product);
iv. Not establish minimum or maximum amounts (except as permitted by the Network Rules), or condition charges for use of VM Payment Cards, and not discourage the use of one VM Payment Card brand over another;
v. Not impose surcharges or taxes (except where permitted by Law and the Network Rules) and, where so done, you will only collect such amounts as part of the submitted charge;
vi. Not submit a Transaction that represents collection of a dishonored check;
vii. Only use the Network logos or marks in a manner permitted by the Network Rules;
viii. Prohibit use of Payment Cards for disbursement of cash (except as permitted by the Network Rules);
ix. Comply with the security obligations identified in the Agreement, including compliance with the PCI Standards and only use cardholder data as permitted, and certify such compliance upon request, and not permit or promote fraudulent use of VM Payment Cards or cardholder data;
x. Make clear to Customers that they are transacting with you prior to, during, and after the Transaction, including providing clear statement descriptors;
xi. Use all reasonable methods to resolve disputes with Customers, including those resulting in a Dispute, and not attempt to recharge a Customer for a Transaction that was previously Disputed and subsequently returned to you unless the recharge is expressly authorized by the Customer; and
xii. Provide clear refund and exchange language that is consistent with Laws and the Network Rules.
Authorization for Settlement and Disbursement of Funds When Member Bank receives funds from the Networks for settlement of your Card Payments (“Settlement Funds”), Member Bank will provide the Settlement Funds to Stripe or Stripe Payments Company, which will accept the Settlement Funds on your behalf. You agree to designate Stripe and Stripe Payments Company as your agent for purposes of receiving Settlement Funds, and you authorize Stripe to instruct Member Bank on your behalf on how and when to make transfers of Settlement Funds to Stripe, including the initiation of holds, receipts, and disbursements of Settlement Funds. Settlement Funds will be held by Stripe in pooled merchant funds accounts pending disbursement to you (or any applicable third-party recipient you have instructed Stripe to make a disbursement to on your behalf) in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, including these Member Bank Terms.You agree you are not entitled to access the Settlement Funds prior to the Settlement Funds being credited by Stripe to your User Bank Account (or the bank account of a third-party recipient to which you have instructed Stripe to make a disbursement on your behalf). You further agree that you have no right to direct Member Bank to distribute Settlement Funds, that you may not assign any interest in any Settlement Funds held by Member Bank, and that you are not entitled to any interest or other compensation associated with the Settlement Funds held by Member Bank. Any authorizations set forth in these Member Bank Terms will remain in full force and effect until your Stripe Account is closed or terminated.
You agree that Member Bank’s transfer of Settlement Funds to your designated agents, Stripe or Stripe Payments Company, satisfies Member Bank’s settlement obligation to you, and that, after Member Bank transfers Settlement Funds to Stripe or Stripe Payments Company, any dispute or claim you may have regarding the receipt or amount of Settlement Funds will be between you and Stripe or Stripe Payments Company. Further, if a cardholder disputes a Transaction, if a Transaction is Disputed for any reason, or if Member Bank reasonably believes a Transaction is unauthorized or otherwise unacceptable, the amount of such Transaction may be Disputed and debited from Settlement Funds held by Member Bank.
Sharing of Data a. You authorize Stripe and Member Bank to provide Protected Data to each other to (i) provide the VM Payment Processing Services, (ii) comply with legal and regulatory obligations, and (iii) perform underwriting and risk review, including verification that you are legally permitted to transact and receive funds. This includes sharing information you provided to Stripe before these Member Bank Terms became effective and information about Member Bank and Stripe’s experience with you, such as termination of these Member Bank Terms by Member Bank and the reasons for such termination. Where required to comply with our obligations under Laws, the Network Rules, or any of Member Bank’s regulatory obligations, Member Bank may provide any data to law enforcement, the Networks, or other government regulators.b. To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires each financial institution to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who establishes a customer relationship with the financial institution. To comply with this requirement, you authorize and direct Stripe to provide to Member Bank any information required to verify your identity, including your name, address, and taxpayer identification number. If you are a legal entity, including a limited liability company or corporation, you authorize and direct Stripe to provide Member Bank with information on the identity of (1) all beneficial owners of 25% or more of the company; and (2) at least one individual with significant control over the company.
Term and Termination These Member Bank Termsbecome effective as provided in the introductory paragraphs and shall continue in effect so long as you use the VM Payment Processing Services.These Member Bank Terms will terminate automatically upon termination of the Agreement, except for those terms which are intended to survive termination. In addition, the VM Payment Processing Services and/or these Member Bank Terms may be terminated by Member Bank, Stripe, or either Network as provided in the introductory paragraphs.
Representations and Warranties In addition to the representations and warranties made in the Agreement, which are incorporated by reference to this Addendum in their entirety, you represent and warrant to Member Bank and Stripe as of each day on which you receive VM Payment Processing Services that:
a. You are legally able to enter into these Member Bank Terms;
b. You will not use the VM Payment Processing Services, directly or indirectly, for any fraudulent or illegal undertaking; and
c. You will only use the VM Payment Processing Services in a manner consistent with the Agreement, including these Member Bank Terms, the Documentation, and Network Rules.
Indemnification Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in the Agreement, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Member Bank, and its respective employees, directors, agents, subcontractors and affiliates (collectively the “Member Bank Entities”) from and against any claim, suit, demand, loss, liability, damage (including indirect or consequential damage), action, or proceeding arising out of or relating to (a) your breach of any provision of the Agreement or these Member Bank Terms; (b) your use of the VM Payment Processing Services; (c) your obligations to pay fees or fines to Stripe, your Customers, Payment Method Providers, or third parties; (d) your negligence or willful misconduct or the negligence or willful misconduct of your employees, contractors, or agents; and (e) all third-party indemnity obligations Member Bank incurs as a direct or indirect result of your acts or omissions (including indemnification of any Network, card issuer, or intermediary bank).
Disclaimer of Warranties THE SERVICES DESCRIBED IN THESE MEMBER BANK TERMS ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, QUALITY, SUITABILTY, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. ALL DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES PROVIDED IN THE AGREEMENT WILL APPLY EQUALLY TO THE MEMBER BANK ENTITIES AS THEY DO TO STRIPE. THE MEMBER BANK ENTITIES (A) ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR OR STRIPE’S FAILURE TO PERFORM OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE AGREEMENT AND (B) DO NOT WARRANT, ENDORSE, GUARANTEE, OR ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY PRODUCT OR SERVICE ADVERTISED OR OFFERED BY YOU, STRIPE, OR ANY THIRD PARTY.
Limitations on Liability In no event will the Member Bank Entities be liable for any lost profits, lost revenue, lost business opportunity, loss of data, or any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages arising out of, in connection with, or relating to the Agreement, these Member Bank Terms, or the VM Payment Processing Services described in either, including without limitation the use of, inability to use, or unavailability of services provided by Stripe. Under no circumstances will any of the Member Bank Entities be responsible for any damage, loss, or injury resulting from hacking, tampering, or other unauthorized access, or use of the VM Payment Processing Services, your Stripe Account, or Protected Data, or your failure to use or implement security, controls, or processes that are appropriate for your business.
The Member Bank Entities assume no liability or responsibility for any (a) personal injury or property damage, of any nature whatsoever, resulting from your access to or use of the VM Payment Processing Services; (b) any misuse of VM Payment Processing Services or Protected Data; (c) any interruption or cessation of transmission to or from the VM Payment Processing Services; (d) any software bugs, viruses, or other harmful code that may be transmitted to, through, or in connection with the VM Payment Processing Services; (e) any errors, inaccuracies, or omissions in the VM Payment Processing Services or data, or any loss or damage resulting therefrom, regardless of the manner of transmission; or (f) defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of any third party.
The Member Bank Entities’ cumulative liability to you is limited to direct damages and in all events will not exceed in the aggregate the amount of fees or compensation actually received by Member Bank from Stripe for the Transactions processed for you through the VM Payment Processing Services during the three (3) month period immediately preceding the event that gives rise to the claim for liability. The limitation of liability in the preceding sentence will not apply to claims by you against Member Bank for direct damages for failure to transfer Settlement Funds to Stripe in accordance with Section 4 of these Member Bank Terms, in which case Member Bank liability for such direct claim by you is limited to the amount of any Settlement Funds that Member Bank failed to transfer to Stripe in accordance with Section 4 of these Member Bank Terms.
Without limiting anything to the contrary above, you agree to provide Member Bank, via a communication with Stripe, with written notice of any alleged breach by Member Bank of these Member Bank Terms, which notice will specifically detail such alleged breach, within sixty (60) days of the date on which you discovered or reasonably should have discovered the alleged breach. Failure to provide notice shall be deemed an acceptance by you and a waiver of any and all rights to dispute such breach.
The foregoing will apply to the fullest extent permitted by law in the applicable jurisdiction and will apply regardless of the legal theory on which the claim is based, including without limitation contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or any other basis. The limitations apply even if Stripe or Member Bank have been advised of the possibility of such damage.
United States Only Services; No Illegal Activities You may not use the VM Payment Processing Services or services of any kind offered by Member Bank from, or on behalf of persons or entities (a) in a country embargoed by the United States or (b) blocked or denied by the United States government. You further acknowledge and agree that you will not use your Stripe Account and/or the VM Payment Processing Services for illegal Transactions, for example, those prohibited by the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act, 31 U.S.C. Section 5361 et seq., as may be amended from time to time, or those involving any Person listed on the U.S. Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (available at www.treas.gov/ofac) or the U.S. Department of State Terrorist Exclusion List (available at www.state.gov) or the processing and acceptance of Transactions in certain jurisdictions pursuant to 31 CFR Part 500 et seq. and other laws enforced by OFAC. Unless otherwise explicitly stated, the VM Payment Processing Services are solely for use by you in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Member Bank Terms, Member Bank may decline to process any Transaction submitted by you in its sole discretion.
Dispute Resolution All disputes under these Member Bank Terms are subject to the applicable provisions of the Agreement. In particular, the dispute resolution, class action waiver, and arbitration provisions of the Agreement apply to disputes under these Member Bank Terms by, with, or against Member Bank in the same manner they apply to disputes by, with, or against Stripe, except that (a) in the event of arbitration, only a federal court (and not an arbitrator) may determine whether a particular claim is arbitrable, and (b) service to Member Bank must be made to its registered agent or to PNC Bank, N.A., 1600 Market Street, 8th Floor, Philadelphia, PA 19103.
Waiver The failure of Member Bank to assert any of its rights under these Member Bank Terms or the Agreement shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver by Member Bank of its rights to enforce each and every provision of these Member Bank Terms or the Agreement in accordance with their terms. These Member Bank Terms may be amended by Member Bank or Stripe from time to time in the same manner as the Agreement may be amended by Stripe.
Miscellaneous These Member Bank Terms are entered into, governed by, and construed pursuant to the laws of the State of New York without regard to conflicts of law provisions. These Member Bank Terms may not be assigned by you without the prior written consent of Member Bank and Stripe. These Member Bank Terms shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors, transferees, and assignees. If any provision of these Member Bank Terms are determined to be illegal or invalid, such illegality or invalidity of that provision will not affect any of the remaining provisions and these Member Bank Terms will be construed as if such provision is not contained in these Member Bank Terms.

The tool to use to install add-on components within IFS Applications is called setup.exe.

setup.exe supports two different types of installations;

runtime environment

server environment

setup.exe will display different set of options based one the selected type and what application components included in the build. The set of possible application options are described in IFS Applications Installation Options in Setup.exe

setup.exe can create another installation, suitable for deploying to a network server for making customized installations to end-user machines.

Running Setup.exe with parameters

The client setup wizard, setup.exe, is scriptable and can be run in interactive or silent mode, both with predefined variables.

SwitchDescription/mSpecify an .ini file that provides the setup with default values.
Syntax: z:\setup.exe /m=D:\setup.ini/sThis switch runs the setup in silent mode. Use this for unattended installations.

Syntax: z:\setup.exe /s/m=D:\setup.ini

A setup.ini file to be used with an automated installation is created by running the setup wizard as a standard installation. When the installation is finished the target directory will contain an setup.ini that contains all values chosen during the installation. This ini file can then be used as input to an automated installation.

Note: The /s flag needs to be the first parameter.

The Parameter File setup.ini

setup.ini will be created when you run setup.exe it will then be stored in the directory specified in the Target Directory page.

You can create it by hand since it is a regular text file.

The file setup.ini contains

Win32 - Installing additional Windows components

Installation of additional components for Windows environment can be performed in two ways: by a customized installation program, or by using the general installation program, i.e. the setup.exe.

Install custom components using Setup.exe

There are two main types or groups of installations that is supported. Each of them is represented as a folder in the base structure of the installation media. This first level of the structure is static and can not be altered.

Win32Client: This group should contain installable components that can be installed on a runtime environment where the user should use built applications or tools.

Win32Server: This group should contain installable server components. Example of this could be the IFS BI Office Apps.

These root folders contains installation component folders. This can be regarded as optional installation packages for a specific type of installation. When the user have chosen the installation type each component within that type will be optional. The name of the subdirectory should reflect the contents of the installation component package and preferably the Application component name.

￼

Example of Installation Component structure

The contents of each installation component are categorized into a fixed set of subfolders. Each of these folders has a connected behavior at install time. To get specific installation behavior for a custom control you should build up the described structure after your need. Note: It's only necessary to create the special folders that are needed e.g. those that you will put files into. The setup executable is not recreating any empty folders at target directory.

Folder nameDescription \ ActionIfs sharedFiles that should be shared between IFS different IFS applications only.

Target: <Program Files>\common files\ifs shared.
Action: Copied including subfolders if file version is same or later.Ifs comIFS COM objects that are shared between different IFS applications only.

Target: <Program Files>\common files\ifs shared
Action: Copied including subfolders if file version is same or later, automatically registered.Common sharedCommon shared folder is exactly the same as the Ifs shared folder with the exception that the base is program files and not program files\ifs. Use this folder whenever you need to install a third party product object that can not be placed in the Ifs structure.Common comCommon com folder is exactly the same as the Ifs com folder with the exception that the base is program files and not program files\ifs. Use this folder whenever you need to install a third party product object that can not be placed in the Ifs structure.ExecuteFiles to be executed during the installation.

Target: These files are not copied anywhere.

Action: Each file is executed by the Setup executable. The setup application is waiting for the created process to end.

Parameters: All cmd and bat files are called with parameters.

InstallationPath - Path to the installation target chosen by the installer.

Start menu root folder - This is the default or user selected folder for the IFS Applications start menu.


Note: Using this folder option will depending on operations performed disable a silent installation. E.g. if files are put here that have a user interface during execution a silent installation will obviously halt and wait for user input.

<Program Files> is the system defined program files target that are defined in the registry for the current installation.

Component Name is the name of the component subdirectory.

Unattended client installation

It is possible to script unattended client installations.

Go through the Client Setup and make the choices that the unattended installation should do.

Retrieve the Setup.ini file that is created at the Installation Target.

Run Client Setup with parameters. z:\setup.exe /s/m=D:\setup.ini


where z:\ is the location of the file server installation
D:\ is the location of the setup.ini file.

Installation using a customized installation program

The tool recommended for writing installations is Windows Installer. Follow the guidelines below when writing installation scripts.

Shared Components

All shared components (DLLs etc. used by more than one application) should be placed in the following folder:

<CLSID_PROGRAM_FILES>\Common Files\IFS Shared\<group name>

Where <CLSID_PROGRAM_FILES> is the Program Files folder. A common path is C:\Program Files. <group name> is a logical grouping of components such as "Graphics Filters" or "Proofing Tools".

Application Specific Components

All application specific files (only used by one application) should be placed in the following folder:

<CLSID_PROGRAM_FILES>\IFS <application name>

where<CLSID_PROGRAM_FILES> is the Program Files folder. A common path is C:\Program Files.<application name> is the name of the application, for example "Document Management".

Start Menu Shortcuts

If the installation creates shortcuts in the Start menu, these should be created under the following menu path:

<CLSID_PROGRAMS>\IFS\<application name>

where<CLSID_PROGRAMS> is the file system directory that contains the user's program groups (which are also file system directories). A common path isC:\WINNT\Profiles\username\Start Menu\Programs. The value forCLSID_PROGRAMS can be retrieved with theSHGetSpecialFolderPath WinAPI function.<application name> is the name of the application, for example "Document Management".

Log Files

The log file is called INSTALL.LOG and is located in the target directory specified in the Target Directory page of the wizard.

Uninstalling

Uninstalling your the installation you made with setup.exe can be done either by selecting Uninstall from the start menu created while running setup.exe, or by running the tool UNWISE.EXE located in the target directory specified in the Target Directory page of the wizard.

+Installing the Sun Java JDK
+
+When you install the Sun Java SDK, you must install it to a path that does not have any spaces.
+
+To install the Sun Java SDK:
+
+Double-click the JDK installer file that you downloaded (jdk-6u43-windows-x64.exe).
+
+The welcome page of the JDK installation wizard is displayed.
+
+
+￼
+
+On the welcome page, click Next.
+
+On the Custom Setup page, because the default installation location (under Program Files) has a space, you must change it here. To change the JDK installation location:
+
+￼
+
+Click the Change button.
+
+In the Folder name field, remove the Program Files directory. This changes the location to: C:\Java\jdk1.6.0_43\
+
+￼
+
+Click OK.
+
+On the Custom Setup page, verify that the installation location has been updated, then click Next.
+
+￼
+
+The Destination Folder page sets the location of the public JRE. Because this JRE is not used by Endeca Information Discovery, you can leave the default directory. Click Next.
+
+￼
+
+The installation process begins.
+
+When the installation is completed, click Finish.

+Installing the Sun Java JDK
+
+When you install the Sun Java SDK, you must install it to a path that does not have any spaces.
+
+To install the Sun Java SDK:
+
+Double-click the JDK installer file that you downloaded (jdk-6u43-windows-x64.exe).
+
+The welcome page of the JDK installation wizard is displayed.
+
+
+￼
+
+On the welcome page, click Next.
+
+On the Custom Setup page, because the default installation location (under Program Files) has a space, you must change it here. To change the JDK installation location:
+
+￼
+
+Click the Change button.
+
+In the Folder name field, remove the Program Files directory. This changes the location to: C:\Java\jdk1.6.0_43\
+
+￼
+
+Click OK.
+
+On the Custom Setup page, verify that the installation location has been updated, then click Next.
+
+￼
+
+The Destination Folder page sets the location of the public JRE. Because this JRE is not used by Endeca Information Discovery, you can leave the default directory. Click Next.
+
+￼
+
+The installation process begins.
+
+When the installation is completed, click Finish.

Installing the Sun Java JDK

When you install the Sun Java SDK, you must install it to a path that does not have any spaces.

To install the Sun Java SDK:

Double-click the JDK installer file that you downloaded (jdk-6u43-windows-x64.exe).

The welcome page of the JDK installation wizard is displayed.


￼

On the welcome page, click Next.

On the Custom Setup page, because the default installation location (under Program Files) has a space, you must change it here. To change the JDK installation location:

￼

Click the Change button.

In the Folder name field, remove the Program Files directory. This changes the location to: C:\Java\jdk1.6.0_43\

￼

Click OK.

On the Custom Setup page, verify that the installation location has been updated, then click Next.

￼

The Destination Folder page sets the location of the public JRE. Because this JRE is not used by Endeca Information Discovery, you can leave the default directory. Click Next.

￼

The installation process begins.

When the installation is completed, click Finish.
