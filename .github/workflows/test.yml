Installation
Copy and paste the following snippet into your .yml file.

Version: v2.5.1 
- name: Setup Node.js environment
  uses: actions/setup-node@v2.5.1
  with:
    # Set always-auth in npmrc
    always-auth: # optional, default is false
    # Version Spec of the version to use.  Examples: 12.x, 10.15.1, >=10.15.0
    node-version: # optional
    # File containing the version Spec of the version to use.  Examples: .nvmrc, .node-version
    node-version-file: # optional
    # Target architecture for Node to use. Examples: x86, x64. Will use system architecture by default.
    architecture: # optional
    # Set this option if you want the action to check for the latest available version that satisfies the version spec
    check-latest: # optional
    # Optional registry to set up for auth. Will set the registry in a project level .npmrc and .yarnrc file, and set up auth to read in from env.NODE_AUTH_TOKEN
    registry-url: # optional
    # Optional scope for authenticating against scoped registries
    scope: # optional
    # Used to pull node distributions from node-versions.  Since there's a default, this is typically not supplied by the user.
    token: # optional, default is ${{ github.token }}
    # Used to specify a package manager for caching in the default directory. Supported values: npm, yarn, pnpm
    cache: # optional
    # Used to specify the path to a dependency file: package-lock.json, yarn.lock, etc. Supports wildcards or a list of file names for caching multiple dependencies.
    cache-dependency-path: # optional
    # Deprecated. Use node-version instead. Will not be supported after October 1, 2019
    version: # optionalDebugging
Logs:
To see the debug output from this action, you must set the secret ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG to true in your repository.
There are many logs, so this can be very helpful!

Statistics:
If the logs are enabled, you can also enable the statistics log which will be visible at the end of the logs once all issues were processed.
This is very helpful to have a quick understanding of the whole stale workflow.
Set enable-statistics to true in your workflow configuration file.

Dry-run:
You can run this action in debug only mode (no actions will be taken on your and pull requests) by passing debug-only to true as an argument to the action.

More operations:
You can increase the maximum number of operations per run by passing operations-per-run to 1000 for example which will help you to handle more operations in a single stale workflow run.
If the debug-only option is enabled, this is very helpful because the workflow will (almost) never reach the GitHub API rate, and you will be able to deep-dive into the logs.

Job frequency:
You could change the cron job frequency in the stale workflow to run the stale workflow more often.
Usually, this is not very helpful though.
