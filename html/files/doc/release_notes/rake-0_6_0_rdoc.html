  <div class="description"><h1><a href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> 0.6.0 Released</h1>
<p>
Its time for some long requested enhancements and lots of bug fixes &#8230;
And a whole new web page.
</p>
<h2>New Web Page</h2>
<p>
The primary documentation for rake has moved from the RubyForge based wiki
to its own Hieraki based web site. Constant spam on the wiki made it a
difficult to keep clean. The new site will be easier to update and
organize.
</p>
<p>
Check out the new documentation at: <a
href="http://docs.rubyrake.org">docs.rubyrake.org</a>
</p>
<p>
We will be adding new documentation to the site as time goes on.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the new docs page, make sure you check out Martin Fowlers
article on rake at <a
href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/rake.html">martinfowler.com/articles/rake.html</a>
</p>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Multiple prerequisites on <a href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a>
rules now allowed. However, keep the following in mind:

<ol>
<li>All the prerequisites of a rule must be available before a rule is
triggered, where &quot;enabled&quot; means (a) an existing file, (b) a
defined rule, or (c) another rule which also must be trigger-able.

</li>
<li>Rules are checked in order of definition, so it is important to order your
rules properly. If a file can be created by two different rules, put the
more specific rule first (otherwise the more general rule will trigger
first and the specific one will never be triggered).

</li>
<li>The <tt>source</tt> method now returns the name of the first prerequisite
listed in the rule. <tt>sources</tt> returns the names of all the rule
prerequisites, ordered as they are defined in the rule. If the task has
other prerequisites not defined in the rule (but defined in an explicit
task definition), then they will <em>not</em> be included in the sources
list.

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>FileLists may now use the egrep command. This popular enhancement is now a
core part of the FileList object. If you want to get a list of all your
to-dos, fixmes and TBD comments, add the following to your Rakefile.

<pre>
  desc &quot;Look for TODO and FIXME tags in the code&quot;
  task :todo do
    FileList['**/*.rb'].egrep /#.*(FIXME|TODO|TBD)/
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>The <tt>investigation</tt> method was added to task object to dump out some
important values. This makes it a bit easier to debug <a
href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> tasks.

<p>
For example, if you are having problems with a particular task, just print
it out:
</p>
<pre>
  task :huh do
    puts Rake::Task['huh'].investigation
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../classes/Rake/TestTask.html">Rake::TestTask</a> class
now supports a &quot;ruby_opts&quot; option to pass arbitrary ruby options
to a test subprocess.

</li>
</ul>
<h3>Some Incompatibilities</h3>
<ul>
<li>When using the <tt>ruby</tt> command to start a Ruby subprocess, the Ruby
interpreter that is currently running rake is used by default. This makes
it easier to use rake in an environment with multiple ruby installation.
(Previously, the first ruby command found in the PATH was used).

<p>
If you wish to chose a different Ruby interpreter, you can explicitly
choose the interpreter via the <tt>sh</tt> command.
</p>
</li>
<li>The major rake classes (Task, FileTask, FileCreationTask, RakeApp) have
been moved out of the toplevel scope and are now accessible as <a
href="../../../classes/Rake/Task.html">Rake::Task</a>, <a
href="../../../classes/Rake/FileTask.html">Rake::FileTask</a>, <a
href="../../../classes/Rake/FileCreationTask.html">Rake::FileCreationTask</a>
and <a href="../../../classes/Rake/Application.html">Rake::Application</a>.
If your Rakefile directly references any one of these tasks, you may:

<ol>
<li>Update your Rakefile to use the new classnames

</li>
<li>Use the &#8212;classic-namespace option on the rake command to get the old
behavior,

</li>
<li>Add <tt>require &#8216;rake/classic_namespace&#8216;</tt> to the Rakefile
to get the old behavior.

</li>
</ol>
<p>
<tt>rake</tt> will print a rather annoying warning whenever a deprecated
class name is referenced without enabling classic namespace.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Several unit tests and functional tests were fixed to run better under
windows.

</li>
<li>Directory tasks are now a specialized version of a File task. A directory
task will only be triggered if it doesn&#8216;t exist. It will not be
triggered if it is out of date w.r.t. any of its prerequisites.

</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the <a
href="../../../classes/Rake/GemPackageTask.html">Rake::GemPackageTask</a>
class so that the gem now properly contains the platform name.

</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where a prerequisite on a <tt>file</tt> task would cause an
exception if the prerequisite did not exist.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is <a href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a></h2>
<p>
<a href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> is a build tool similar to
the make program in many ways. But instead of cryptic make recipes, <a
href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> uses standard Ruby code to
declare tasks and dependencies. You have the full power of a modern
scripting language built right into your build tool.
</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>
The easiest way to get and install rake is via RubyGems &#8230;
</p>
<pre>
  gem install rake    (you may need root/admin privileges)
</pre>
<p>
Otherwise, you can get it from the more traditional places:
</p>
<table>
<tr><td valign="top">Home Page:</td><td><a href="http://rake.rubyforge.org">rake.rubyforge.org</a>/

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">Download:</td><td><a
href="http://rubyforge.org/project/showfiles.php?group_id=50">rubyforge.org/project/showfiles.php?group_id=50</a>

</td></tr>
</table>
<h2>Thanks</h2>

As usual, it was input from users that drove a alot of these changes. The
following people either contributed patches, made suggestions or made
otherwise helpful comments. Thanks to &#8230;
</p>
<ul>
<li>Greg Fast (better ruby_opt test options)

</li>
<li>Kelly Felkins (requested by better namespace support)

</li>
<li>Martin Fowler (suggested Task.investigation)

</li>
<li>Stuart Jansen (send initial patch for multiple prerequisites).

</li>
<li>Masao Mutch (better support for non-ruby Gem platforms)

</li>
<li>Philipp Neubeck (patch for file task exception fix)

</li>
</ul>
