  <div class="description"><h1><a href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> 0.7.2 Released</h1>
<p>
Version 0.7.2 supplies a bug fix and a few minor enhancements. In
particular, the new version fixes an incompatibility with the soon to be
released Ruby 1.8.6. We strongly recommend upgrading to <a
href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> 0.7.2 in order to be compatible
with the new version of Ruby.
</p>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<h3>Bug Fixes in 0.7.2</h3>
<p>
There are quite a number of bug fixes in the new 0.7.2 version of <a
href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed dependency on internal fu_xxx functions from <a
href="../../../classes/FileUtils.html">FileUtils</a>.

</li>
<li>Error messages are now send to stderr rather than stdout (from Payton
Quackenbush).

</li>
<li>Better error handling on invalid command line arguments (from Payton
Quackenbush).

</li>
<li>Fixed some bugs where the application object was going to the global
appliation instead of using its own data.

</li>
<li>Fixed the method name leak from <a
href="../../../classes/FileUtils.html">FileUtils</a> (bug found by Glenn
Vanderburg).

</li>
<li>Added test for noop, bad_option and verbose flags to sh command.

</li>
<li>Added a description to the gem task in GemPackageTask.

</li>
<li>Fixed a bug when rules have multiple prerequisites (patch by Joel
VanderWerf)

</li>
<li>Added the handful of <a
href="../../../classes/RakeFileUtils.html">RakeFileUtils</a> to the private
method as well.

</li>
</ul>
<h3>New Features in 0.7.2</h3>
<p>
The following new features are available in <a
href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> version 0.7.2:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added square and curly bracket patterns to FileList#include (Tilman
Sauerbeck).

</li>
<li>FileLists can now pass a block to FileList#exclude to exclude files based
on calculated values.

</li>
<li>Added plain filename support to rule dependents (suggested by Nobu Nakada).

</li>
<li>Added pathmap support to rule dependents. In other words, if a pathmap
format (beginning with a &#8217;%&#8217;) is given as a <a
href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> rule dependent, then the name of
the depend will be the name of the target with the pathmap format applied.

</li>
<li>Added a &#8216;tasks&#8217; method to a namespace to get a list of tasks
associated with the namespace.

</li>
<li>Added tar_command and zip_command options to the Package task.

</li>
<li>The clean task will no longer delete &#8216;core&#8217; if it is a
directory.

</li>
</ul>
<h3>Internal <a href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> Improvements</h3>
<p>
The following changes will are mainly internal improvements and
refactorings and have little effect on the end user. But they may be of
interest to the general public.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added rcov task and updated unit testing for better code coverage.

</li>
<li>Added a &#8216;shame&#8217; task to the Rakefile.

</li>
<li>Added rake_extension to handle detection of extension collisions.

</li>
<li>Added a protected &#8216;require &quot;rubygems&quot;&#8217; to
test/test_application to unbreak cruisecontrol.rb.

</li>
<li>Removed rake_dup. Now we just simply rescue a bad dup.

</li>
<li>Refactored the FileList reject logic to remove duplication.

</li>
<li>Removed if <em>FILE</em> at the end of the rake.rb file.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is <a href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a></h2>
<p>
<a href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> is a build tool similar to
the make program in many ways. But instead of cryptic make recipes, <a
href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> uses standard Ruby code to
declare tasks and dependencies. You have the full power of a modern
scripting language built right into your build tool.
</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>
The easiest way to get and install rake is via RubyGems &#8230;
</p>
<pre>
  gem install rake    (you may need root/admin privileges)
</pre>
<p>
Otherwise, you can get it from the more traditional places:

otherwise helpful comments. Thanks to &#8230;
