  <div class="description"><h1><a href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> 0.5.0 Released</h1>
<p>
Although it has only been two weeks since the last release, we have enough
updates to the <a href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> program to
make it time for another release.
</p>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>
Here are the changes for version 0.5.3 &#8230;
</p>
<ul>
<li>FileLists have been extensively changed so that they mimic the behavior of
real arrays even more closely. In particular, operations on FileLists that
return a new collection (e.g. collect, reject) will now return a FileList
rather than an array. In addition, several places where FileLists were not
properly expanded before use have been fixed.

</li>
<li>A method (<tt>ext</tt>) to simplify the handling of file extensions was
added to <a href="../../../classes/String.html">String</a> and to Array.

</li>
<li>The &#8216;testrb&#8217; script in test/unit tends to silently swallow
syntax errors in test suites. Because of that, the default test loader is
now a rake-provided script. You can still use &#8216;testrb&#8217; by
setting the loader flag in the test task to :testrb. (See the API documents
for TestTask for all the loader flag values).

</li>
<li>FileUtil methods (e.g. cp, mv, install) are now declared to be private.
This will cut down on the interference with user defined methods of the
same name.

</li>
<li>Fixed the verbose flag in the TestTask so that the test code is controlled
by the flag. Also shortened up some failure messages. (Thanks to Tobias
Luetke for the suggestion).

</li>
<li>Rules will now properly detect a task that can generate a source file.
Previously rules would only consider source files that were already
present.

</li>
<li>Added an <tt>import</tt> command that allows <a
href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> to dynamically import
dependendencies into a running <a
href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> session. The <tt>import</tt>
command can run tasks to update the dependency file before loading them.
Dependency files can be in rake or make format, allowing rake to work with
tools designed to generate dependencies for make.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is <a href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a></h2>
<p>
<a href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> is a build tool similar to
the make program in many ways. But instead of cryptic make recipes, <a
href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> uses standard Ruby code to
declare tasks and dependencies. You have the full power of a modern
scripting language built right into your build tool.
</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>
The easiest way to get and install rake is via RubyGems &#8230;
</p>
<pre>
  gem install rake    (you may need root/admin privileges)
</pre>
<p>
Otherwise, you can get it from the more traditional places:

<h2>Thanks</h2>
<p>
As usual, it was input from users that drove a alot of these changes.
Thanks to &#8230;
</p>
<ul>
<li>Brian Gernhardt for the rules fix (especially for the patience to explain
the problem to me until I got what he was talking about).

</li>
<li>Stefan Lang for pointing out problems in the dark corners of the FileList
implementation.

</li>
<li>Alexey Verkhovsky pointing out the silently swallows syntax errors in
tests.

</li>
<li>Tobias Luetke for beautifying the test task output.

</li>
<li>Sam Roberts for some of the ideas behind dependency loading.
