  <div class="description"><h1><a href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> 0.8.0/0.8.1 Released</h1>
<p>
<a href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> version 0.8.0 is a new
release of rake that includes serveral new features.
</p>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<h3>New Features in Version 0.8.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tasks can now receive command line parameters. See the examples below for
more details.

</li>
<li>Comments are limited to 80 columns on output, but full comments can be seen
by using the -D parameter. (feature suggested by Jamis Buck).

</li>
<li>Explicit exit(n) calls will now set the exit status to n. (patch provided
by Stephen Touset).

</li>
<li><a href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> is now compatible with Ruby
1.9.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Version 0.8.1 is a minor update that includes additional Ruby 1.9
compatibility fixes.
</p>
<h2>What is <a href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a></h2>
<p>
<a href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> is a build tool similar to
the make program in many ways. But instead of cryptic make recipes, <a
href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> uses standard Ruby code to
declare tasks and dependencies. You have the full power of a modern
scripting language built right into your build tool.
</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>
The easiest way to get and install rake is via RubyGems &#8230;
</p>
<pre>
  gem install rake    (you may need root/admin privileges)
</pre>
<p>
Otherwise, you can get it from the more traditional places:
</p>
<table>
<tr><td valign="top">Home Page:</td><td><a href="http://rake.rubyforge.org">rake.rubyforge.org</a>/

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">Download:</td><td><a
href="http://rubyforge.org/project/showfiles.php?group_id=50">rubyforge.org/project/showfiles.php?group_id=50</a>

</td></tr>
</table>
<h2>Task Argument Examples</h2>
<p>
Prior to version 0.8.0, rake was only able to handle command line arguments
of the form NAME=VALUE that were passed into <a
href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> via the ENV hash. Many folks had
asked for some kind of simple command line arguments, perhaps using
&quot;&#8212;&quot; to separate regular task names from argument values on
the command line. The problem is that there was no easy way to associate
positional arguments on the command line with different tasks. Suppose both
tasks :a and :b expect a command line argument: does the first value go
with :a? What if :b is run first? Should it then get the first command line
argument.
</p>
<p>
<a href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> 0.8.0 solves this problem by
explicitly passing values directly to the tasks that need them. For
example, if I had a release task that required a version number, I could
say:
</p>
<pre>
   rake release[0.8.0]
</pre>
<p>
And the string &quot;0.8.0&quot; will be passed to the :release task.
Multiple arguments can be passed by separating them with a comma, for
example:
</p>
<pre>
   rake name[john,doe]
</pre>
<p>
Just a few words of caution. The rake task name and its arguments need to
be a single command line argument to rake. This generally means no spaces.
If spaces are needed, then the entire rake + argument string should be
quoted. Something like this:
</p>
<pre>
   rake &quot;name[billy bob, smith]&quot;
</pre>
<p>
(Quoting rules vary between operating systems and shells, so make sure you
consult the proper docs for your OS/shell).
</p>
<h3>Tasks that Expect Parameters</h3>
<p>
Parameters are only given to tasks that are setup to expect them. In order
to handle named parameters, the task declaration syntax for tasks has been
extended slightly.
</p>
<p>
For example, a task that needs a first name and last name might be declared
as:
</p>
<pre>
   task :name, :first_name, :last_name
</pre>
<p>
The first argument is still the name of the task (:name in this case). The
next to argumements are the names of the parameters expected by :name
(:first_name and :last_name in the example).
</p>
<p>
To access the values of the paramters, the block defining the task
behaviour can now accept a second parameter:
</p>
<pre>
   task :name, :first_name, :last_name do |t, args|
     puts &quot;First name is #{args.first_name}&quot;
     puts &quot;Last  name is #{args.last_name}&quot;
   end
</pre>
<p>
The first argument of the block &quot;t&quot; is always bound to the
current task object. The second argument &quot;args&quot; is an open-struct
like object that allows access to the task arguments. Extra command line
arguments to a task are ignored. Missing command line arguments are given
the nil value.
</p>
