= Rake Changelog

== Pre-Version 0.7.2

* Error messages are now send to stderr rather than stdout (from
  Payton Quackenbush).
* Better error handling on invalid command line arguments (from Payton
  Quackenbush).
* Added rcov task and updated unit testing for better code coverage.
* Fixed some bugs where the application object was going to the global
  appliation instead of using its own data.
* Added square and curly bracket patterns to FileList#include (Tilman
  Sauerbeck). 
* Added plain filename support to rule dependents (suggested by Nobu
  Nakada). 
* Added pathmap support to rule dependents.
* Added a 'tasks' method to a namespace to get a list of tasks
  associated with the namespace.
* Fixed the method name leak from FileUtils (bug found by Glenn
  Vanderburg). 
* Added rake_extension to handle detection of extension collisions.
* Added test for noop, bad_option and verbose flags to sh command.

== Version 0.7.1

* Added optional filter parameter to the --tasks command line option.
* Added flatten to allow rule transform procs to return lists of
  prereqs (Joel VanderWerf provided patch).
* Added pathmap to String and FileList.
* The -r option will now load .rake files (but a straight require
  doesn't yet).  NOTE: This is experimental ... it may be
  discontinued.
* The -f option without a value will disable the search for a
  Rakefile.  The assumption is that the -r files are adequate.
* Fixed the safe_ln function to fall back to cp in more error
  scenarios.

== Version 0.7.0

* Added Rake.original_dir to return the original starting directory of
  the rake application.
* Added safe_ln support for openAFS (from Ludvig Omholt).
* Added --trace reminder on short exception messages (David Heinemeier
  Hansson suggestion).
* Added multitask declaration that executes prerequisites in
  parallel. (Doug Young providied an initial implementation).
* Fixed missing_const hack to be compatible with Rails. (Jamis Buck
  supplied test case).
* Made the RDoc task default to internal (in-process) RDoc formatting.
  The old behavior is still available by setting the +external+ flag
  to true.
* Rakefiles are now loaded with the expanded path to prevent
  accidental polution from the Ruby load path.
* The +namespace+ command now returns a NameSpace object that can be
  used to lookup tasks defined in that namespace.  This allows for
  better anonymous namespace behavior.
* Task objects my now be used in prerequisite lists directly.

== Version 0.6.1

* Rebuilt 0.6.0 gem without signing.

== Version 0.6.0

* Fixed file creation bug in the unit tests (caused infinite loop on
  windows).
* Fixed bug where session based functional tests were run under
  windows.
* Fixed bug in directory tasks so that updating a directory will not
  retrigger file tasks depending on the directory (see
  FileCreationTask and EarlyTime).
* Added egrep to FileList
* ruby command now runs same ruby version as rake.
* Added investigation to task object. (suggested by Martin Fowler)
* Added ruby_opts to the test task to allow arbitrary ruby options to
  be passed to the test script. (Greg Fast)
* Fixed the test loader to ignore options. (Greg Fast)
* Moved Task, FileTask, FileCreationTask and RakeApp into the Rake
  module namespace.  Old style namespace behavior can be invoked via
  the --classic-namespace option. (requested by Kelly Felkins).
* GemTask is now sensitive to the gem platform (Masao Mutoh).
* A non-existing file prerequisite will no longer cause an exception
  (Philipp Neubeck).
* Multiple prerequisites on Rake rules now allowed (initial patch
  supplied by Stuart Jansen).

== Version 0.5.4

* Added double quotes to the test runner.
* Added .svn to default ignore list.
* Updated FileList#include to support nested arrays and filelists.

== Version 0.5.3

* Added support for importing Rakefile and other dependencies.
* Fixed bug so that now rules can chain off of existing tasks as well
  as existing files.
* Fixed verbose flag bug in the testing task.  Shortened some failure
  messages.
* Make FileUtils methods private at the top level module to avoid
  accidental method leaking into other objects.
* Added test loader option to test task.  "testrb" is no longer the
  default test loader.  It is now eating syntax errors that should
  halt the unit tests.
* Revamped FileList so that it works more like and array (addressed
  flatten bug).  Added many tests around file list.
* Added +ext+ method to both String and FileList.

== Version 0.5.0

* Fixed documentation that was lacking the Rake module name (Tilman
  Sauerbeck).
* Added tar.gz and tar.bz2 support to package task (Tilman Sauerbeck).
* Recursive rules are now supported (Tilman Sauerbeck).
* Added warning option for the Test Task (requested by Eric Hodel).
* The jamis rdoc template is only used if it exists.
* Added fix for Ruby 1.8.2 test/unit and rails problem.
* Added contributed rake man file (Jani Monoses).
* Added Brian Candler's fix for problems in --trace and --dry-run
  mode.

== Version 0.4.15

* Fixed a bug that prevented the TESTOPTS flag from working with the
  revised for 1.8.2 test task.
* Updated the docs on --trace to indicate that it also enables a full
  backtrace on errors. 

== Version 0.4.14

* Modified the TestTask to workaround the Ruby 1.8.2 change in
  autoexecuting unit tests.

== Version 0.4.13

* Fixed the dry-run flag so it is operating again.
* Multiple arguments to sh and ruby commands will not be interpreted
  by the shell (patch provided by Jonathan Paisley).

== Version 0.4.12

* Added --silent (-s) to suppress the (in directory) rake message.

== Version 0.4.11

* Changed the "don't know how to rake" message (finally)
* Changes references to a literal "Rakefile" to reference the global
  variable $rakefile (which contains the actual name of the rakefile).

== Version 0.4.10

* Added block support to the "sh" command, allowing users to take
  special actions on the result of the system call.  E.g.

    sh "shell_command" do |ok, res|
      puts "Program returned #{res.exitstatus}" if ! ok
    end

== Version 0.4.9

* Switched to Jamis Buck's RDoc template.
* Removed autorequire from Rake's gem spec.  This prevents the Rake
  libraries from loading while using rails.

== Version 0.4.8

* Added support for .rb versions of Rakefile.
* Removed \\\n's from test task.
* Fixed Ruby 1.9 compatibility issue with FileList.

== Version 0.4.7

* Fixed problem in FileList that caused Ruby 1.9 to go into infinite
  recursion.  Since to_a was removed from Object, it does not need to
  added back into the list of methods to rewrite in FileList.  (Thanks
  to Kent Sibilev for pointing this out).

== Version 0.4.6
* Removed test version of ln in FileUtils that prevented safe_ln from
  using ln.

== Version 0.4.5
* Upgraded comments in TestTask.
* FileList to_s and inspect now automatically resolve pending changes.
* FileList#exclude properly returns the FileList.

== Version 0.4.4
* Fixed initialization problem with @comment.
* Now using multi -r technique in TestTask.  Switch Rakefile back to
  using the built-in test task macros because the rake runtime is no
  longer needed.
* Added 'TEST=filename' and 'TESTOPTS=options' to the Test Task
  macros.
* Allow a +test_files+ attribute in test tasks.  This allows more
  flexibility in specifying test files.

== Version 0.4.3
* Fixed Comment leakage.

== Version 0.4.2
* Added safe_ln that falls back to a copy if a file link is not supported.
* Package builder now uses safe_ln.

== Version 0.4.1
* Task comments are now additive, combined with "/".
* Works with (soon to be released) rubygems 0.6.2 (or 0.7.0)

== Version 0.4.0
* FileList now uses deferred loading.  The file system is not searched
  until the first call that needs the file names.
* VAR=VALUE options are now accepted on the command line and are
  treated like environment variables.  The values may be tested in a
  Rakefile by referencing ENV['VAR'].
* File.mtime is now used (instead of File.new().mtime).

== Version 0.3.2.x

* Removed some hidden dependencies on rubygems.  Tests now will test
  gems only if they are installed.

  reference to Sys outside of the contrib area.
