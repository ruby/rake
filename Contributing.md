Description
Rake is a Make-like program implemented in Ruby. Tasks and dependencies are specified in standard Ruby syntax.

Rake has the following features:

Rakefiles (rake's version of Makefiles) are completely defined in standard Ruby syntax. No XML files to edit. No quirky Makefile syntax to worry about (is that a tab or a space?)

Users can specify tasks with prerequisites.

Rake supports rule patterns to synthesize implicit tasks.

Flexible FileLists that act like arrays but know about manipulating file names and paths.

A library of prepackaged tasks to make building rakefiles easier. For example, tasks for building tarballs. (Formerly tasks for building RDoc, Gems, and publishing to FTP were included in rake but they're now available in RDoc, RubyGems, and rake-contrib respectively.)

Supports parallel execution of tasks.

Installation
Gem Installation
Download and install rake with the following.

gem install rake
Usage
Simple Example
First, you must write a ‚ÄúRakefile‚Äù file which contains the build rules. Here's a simple example:

task default: %w[test]

task :test do
  ruby "test/unittest.rb"
end
This Rakefile has two tasks:

A task named ‚Äútest‚Äù, which ‚Äì upon invocation ‚Äì will run a unit test file in Ruby.

A task named ‚Äúdefault‚Äù. This task does nothing by itself, but it has exactly one dependency, namely the ‚Äútest‚Äù task. Invoking the ‚Äúdefault‚Äù task will cause Rake to invoke the ‚Äútest‚Äù task as well.

Running the ‚Äúrake‚Äù command without any options will cause it to run the ‚Äúdefault‚Äù task in the Rakefile:

% ls
Rakefile     test/
% rake
(in /home/some_user/Projects/rake)
ruby test/unittest.rb
....unit test output here...
Type ‚Äúrake ‚Äìhelp‚Äù for all available options.
